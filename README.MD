## About This Portfolio

This repository contains my personal portfolio website, showcasing projects built during my transition into software development.

I am currently completing an intensive, practical software development program focused on:

- HTML & semantic markup
- CSS / SCSS
- JavaScript (ES6+)
- React
- Java fundamentals
- APIs & asynchronous programming
- Test-driven development (TDD)
- Cloud basics

Alongside development, I have over five years of experience in SaaS customer success and application support (Salesforce, HubSpot, Oracle, SAP, Infor M3). This background influences how I approach problem-solving, system design, and user experience.

I also have a strong interest in digital art and UI/UX design, which informs how I structure layouts and build clean, user-focused interfaces.

## Technologies Used (Portfolio Site)

- HTML5
- SCSS(modular structure)
- JavaScript
- Git & GitHub
- GitHub Pages (deployment)

- Real-world patterns (cart systems, stock control, checkout flow)

## Purpose

This portfolio represents my transition into software development and demonstrates:

- Technical growth
- Practical project work
- Understanding of front-end architecture
- Exposure to full-stack concepts

It will continue evolving as I build more advanced applications and deepen my understanding of software engineering principles.

## Status

Actively maintained and updated as I continue studying and building new projects.
